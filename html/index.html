          <h1> Jared Craig Clifton</h1>
          <p>I went on to the crowd.  There were really, I should think, two or three hundred people elbowing and jostling one another, the one or two ladies there being by no means the least active. "He's fallen in the pit!" cried some one. "Keep back!" said several. The crowd swayed a little, and I elbowed my way through.  Every one seemed greatly excited.  I heard a peculiar humming sound from the pit. "I say!" said Ogilvy; "help keep these idiots back.  We don't know what's in the confounded thing, you know!" I saw a young man, a shop assistant in Woking I believe he was, standing on the cylinder and trying to scramble out of the hole again. The crowd had pushed him in.</p>

          <h1>About Me:</h1>
          <p>Before he could get to it, he heard a scream under the wheels, and saw through the dust the rim passing over the poor wretch's back.  The driver of the cart slashed his whip at my brother, who ran round behind the cart.  The multitudinous shouting confused his ears.  The man was writhing in the dust among his scattered money, unable to rise, for the wheel had broken his back, and his lower limbs lay limp and dead.  My brother stood up and yelled at the next driver, and a man on a black horse came to his assistance.</p>
          <p>There was a smash as the pole of a carriage crashed into the cart that the man on horseback stopped.  My brother looked up, and the man with the gold twisted his head round and bit the wrist that held his collar.  There was a concussion, and the black horse came staggering sideways, and the carthorse pushed beside it.  A hoof missed my brother's foot by a hair's breadth.  He released his grip on the fallen man and jumped back.  He saw anger change to terror on the face of the poor wretch on the ground, and in a moment he was hidden and my brother was borne backward and carried past the entrance of the lane, and had to fight hard in the torrent to recover it.</p>
          <p>Then beyond the bend my brother stopped again.  Miss Elphinstone was white and pale, and her sister-in-law sat weeping, too wretched even to call upon "George."  My brother was horrified and perplexed. So soon as they had retreated he realised how urgent and unavoidable it was to attempt this crossing.  He turned to Miss Elphinstone, suddenly resolute.</p>
