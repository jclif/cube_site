          <h1> Jared Craig Clifton</h1>
          <p>I went on to the crowd.  There were really, I should think, two or three hundred people elbowing and jostling one another, the one or two ladies there being by no means the least active. "He's fallen in the pit!" cried some one. "Keep back!" said several. The crowd swayed a little, and I elbowed my way through.  Every one seemed greatly excited.  I heard a peculiar humming sound from the pit. "I say!" said Ogilvy; "help keep these idiots back.  We don't know what's in the confounded thing, you know!" I saw a young man, a shop assistant in Woking I believe he was, standing on the cylinder and trying to scramble out of the hole again. The crowd had pushed him in.</p>

          <h1>About Me:</h1>
          <p>"Way!" cried the men all about him.  "Make way!"</p>

          <p>So soon as the cab had passed, he flung himself, with both hands open, upon the heap of coins, and began thrusting handfuls in his pocket.  A horse rose close upon him, and in another moment, half rising, he had been borne down under the horse's hoofs.</p>

          <p>"Stop!" screamed my brother, and pushing a woman out of his way, tried to clutch the bit of the horse.</p>

          <p>Before he could get to it, he heard a scream under the wheels, and saw through the dust the rim passing over the poor wretch's back.  The driver of the cart slashed his whip at my brother, who ran round behind the cart.  The multitudinous shouting confused his ears.  The man was writhing in the dust among his scattered money, unable to rise, for the wheel had broken his back, and his lower limbs lay limp and dead.  My brother stood up and yelled at the next driver, and a man on a black horse came to his assistance.</p>

          <p>"Get him out of the road," said he; and, clutching the man's collar with his free hand, my brother lugged him sideways.  But he still clutched after his money, and regarded my brother fiercely, hammering at his arm with a handful of gold.  "Go on!  Go on!" shouted angry voices behind.</p>

          <p>"Way!  Way!"</p>

          <p>There was a smash as the pole of a carriage crashed into the cart that the man on horseback stopped.  My brother looked up, and the man with the gold twisted his head round and bit the wrist that held his collar.  There was a concussion, and the black horse came staggering sideways, and the carthorse pushed beside it.  A hoof missed my brother's foot by a hair's breadth.  He released his grip on the fallen man and jumped back.  He saw anger change to terror on the face of the poor wretch on the ground, and in a moment he was hidden and my brother was borne backward and carried past the entrance of the lane, and had to fight hard in the torrent to recover it.</p>

          <p>He saw Miss Elphinstone covering her eyes, and a little child, with all a child's want of sympathetic imagination, staring with dilated eyes at a dusty something that lay black and still, ground and crushed under the rolling wheels.  "Let us go back!" he shouted, and began turning the pony round. "We cannot cross this--hell," he said and they went back a hundred yards the way they had come, until the fighting crowd was hidden.  As they passed the bend in the lane my brother saw the face of the dying man in the ditch under the privet, deadly white and drawn, and shining with perspiration.  The two women sat silent, crouching in their seat and shivering.</p>

          <p>Then beyond the bend my brother stopped again.  Miss Elphinstone was white and pale, and her sister-in-law sat weeping, too wretched even to call upon "George."  My brother was horrified and perplexed. So soon as they had retreated he realised how urgent and unavoidable it was to attempt this crossing.  He turned to Miss Elphinstone, suddenly resolute.</p>

          <p>"We must go that way," he said, and led the pony round again.</p>
